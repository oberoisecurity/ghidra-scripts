#Ghidra Scripts
Collection of various small Ghidra scripts to assist in reverse engineering.

## Installation
Copy script(s) to your Ghidra/Features/Python/ghidra_scripts/ directory. 

## DisassembleAddresses.py
Simple script to disassemble all addresses from a text file. Each address should be in hex and on it's own line. I found it useful when reverse engineering a memory dump that Ghidra did not disassemble well.
